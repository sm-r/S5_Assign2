Namenode :
 - master daemon
 - 1 per cluster (1.x)
 - manages namespace
 - receives heartbeat from data nodes
 - namespace has 2 files fsimage & edit_log
 - fsimage is the initial state of the namespace
 - edit_log maintains the transactions
 - Secondary namenode is responsible for checkpointing
      -merges the fsimage and edit_log to create new fs_image
 - Co-ordinates with the RM to provide the list of data nodes where specific data is stored

Data Node
-------
  - Slave daemon
  - Responsible for reading and writing of data
  - 1 per node
  - sends heartbeat to NN every 3 secs
  - part of the distributed storage solution

Resource manager
---------------
   - Master daemon
   - mantains the node managers & their resources list
   - co-ordinates with NN to get details of DNs for the specific jobs
   - When client contacts the RM for execution of job,
      instructs one of the NM to initiate the container Application Manager
   - If the syntax of the job submitted is correct then returns the app_id to client
   - Receives heartbeat from NMs. In case of NM failure, provides alternative NM details to AM

Node Manager:
-------------
   - Slave daemon
   - part of the distributed processing solution
   - co-ordinates with AM for initiating the task trackers
   - sends heartbeat to RM
   - 1 per node


Job execution process
---------------------

> Client submits the job to RM
> If the syntax is correct, RM returns app_id for the job
> After recieving the app_id, client copies the job details (Jar, input file name, output folder name) to distributed cache
> Job scheduler component of RM informs RM abt the scheduled job
> RM contacts the NN to get details of available DNs
    - instructs one of the NM to initiate AM
> AM contacts RM to get details of NMs to execute the tasks
>  AM instructs the NM to initate the task container 
> NM copies logic from DC and initiate task tracker
> Task tracker sends the heart beats to AM abt the job in progress
> After all the tasks are finished, AM compiles the results
> RM instructs the NM to dissolve the AM after the job is finished
